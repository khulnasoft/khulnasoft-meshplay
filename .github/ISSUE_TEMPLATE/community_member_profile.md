**Current Behavior**

<@github-username> has been a consistent contributor and community member.

**Desired Situation**
Let's recognize <@github-username> as a contributor and community member by creating a profile on https://khulnasoft.com/community/members.

- GitHub: <!-- username only -->
- Twitter: <!-- handle only -->
- LinkedIn: <!-- <profilename> only https://www.linkedin.com/in/<profilename> -->
- KhulnaSoft Cloud: <!-- <user ID> only UUID https://meshplay.khulnasoft.com/user/<uuid> -->
- Link to profile picture:

A detailed explanation on how to set up a community member profile can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
