<h2>Integrating with Meshplay: Using extension points</h2>

As the cloud native manager, Meshplay, is an extensible platform offering user and integrators well-crafted, extension points. Extension points allow you to  augment the behavior of Meshplay by either adding entirely new capabilities or affecting the behavior of existing functionality, as see in the figure below.

<div class="img-center">
  <a href={MeshplayExtensibility} style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)"><img src={MeshplayExtensibility} /></a>
</div>

As you can see in the diagram, Meshplay offers many types of extension points.

- <strong>Extensible Service Mesh Adapters</strong> - bring your own service mesh.
- <strong>Extensible APIs</strong> - bring your own GraphQL resolvers and expose new, custom endpoints.
- <strong>Extensible Load Generators</strong> - Meshplay supports three types of load generators, however, you can bring your own and plug it in.
- <strong>Extensible Providers</strong> - the v0.5.0 release delivers dynamic injection of Remote Provider extensions. Providers are a powerful mechanism for integrating Meshplay into your existing tooling and systems.

There are two types of Providers in Meshplay: Local - built into Meshplay and Remote - implemented by anyone or any organization that wishes to integrate with Meshplay. Remote Provider extensibility includes:

  * Pluggable UI functionality
  * Pluggable Backend functionality
  * Pluggable Authentication and Authorization
  * Long-Term Persistence
  * Enhanced Visualization
  * Historical Reporting  

Learn more about the platform Meshplay provides to extend its funcionality by exploring its <Link to="https://docs.meshplay.khulnasoft.com/extensibility">extension points</Link>. If you have or are building your own <Link to="https://docs.meshplay.khulnasoft.com/extensibility/providers">Remote Provider</Link>, let us know!
<h2>MeshKit and Meshplay Adapter Library</h2>

As a service mesh toolkit, MeshKit aims to specifically focus on service mesh management and provides broadly useful functionality, it provides a standard policy for error handling and logging across all Meshplay components, and implementations for error handling, logging, and tracing.

<ul>
  <li>MeshKit provides common data models of Service Mesh Interface conformance testing for Meshplay.</li>
  <li>The low-level API abstract by MeshKit to the high-level functions provides out-of-the-box functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Meshplay Adapter Library</h3>

<p>The Meshplay Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.</p>
<div class="img-center">
  <a href={MeshplayAdapterLibrary}><img src={MeshplayAdapterLibrary} /></a>
</div>

* The library provides a set of interfaces, some with default implementations like a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh-specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.
* The default configuration provider we use Viper to reads the adapter specific configuration, and the configuration providers are implementations of an interface, this can be flexible if anyone wants to implement it on their own.

With the increasing the number and diversity of service meshes supported by Meshplay, you might find the list of [Supported Service Meshes](https://docs.meshplay.khulnasoft.com/service-meshes) a helpful, complete list.

<h2>Meshplay Operator</h2>
<img style="float: left;max-width:300px; width:20%;padding: 1.25rem;" src={MeshplayOperator} />
<p style="display:block;width:100%;">
As a Kubernetes custom controller, Meshplay Operator provides a Kubernetes-native approach to interfacing with Meshplay. Kubernetes is where service meshes have gotten their initial foothold, and therefore, important that Meshplay interface to Kubernetes natively.</p><p>Some service meshes support non-containerized workloads outside of the cluster and will grow in this focus over time. While Meshplay Operator is Kubernetes only in the v0.5.0 release, Meshplay's arichitecture makes considerations for different workload and platform types.</p>

<div style="display:flex;width:100%;">
  <div style="text-align:center;flex:50%;">
    <a href={MeshplayOperatorShot} style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)"><img style="width:100%;" src={MeshplayOperatorShot} /></a>
  </div>
  <ul style="flex:50%;">
    <li>Meshplay Operator is the multi-service mesh operator that runs as a Kubernetes Operator and defines two custom resources: MeshSync and Meshplay Broker (NATS)</li>
    <li>Meshplay Operator is provides abilities includes cluster discovery, service mesh discovery, and data streaming via NATS.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>MeshSync</h3>
<p>MeshSync is available as a Kubernetes custom resource that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshplay Server as to the state of the Kubernetes cluster, service meshes, and their workloads.</p>

<div style="display:flex;">
<img style="max-width:300px; width:20%;padding: 1.25rem;" src={MeshSync} />
<ul>

  <li>MeshSync is one of a family of custom controllers within Meshplay Operator and is the <Link to="https://docs.meshplay.khulnasoft.com/concepts/architecture/meshsync">heartbeat of Meshplay</Link>, pumping information about service meshes and their workloads throughout Meshplay's components.</li>
  <li>MeshSync helps Meshplay mesh with meshes by helping define a service mesh agnostic object model.</li>
  <li>It provides ability to detect service meshes and services deployed on the cluster, and snapshot stored in-memory and refreshed periodically; 
maintain the local snapshot of the cluster and refreshed periodically.</li>
  <li>MeshSync These abilities above help Meshplay operations more resilient.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h4>Relational Database</h4>

Meshplay's <a href="https://docs.meshplay.khulnasoft.com/concepts/architecture/database">relational database</a> serves as a repository for MeshSync data, user preferences, and system settings. This database should be considered ephemeral and given that it operates as a cache. Meshplay relational database offers federated datasets for managing multiple Kubernetes cluster and multiple service meshes.

## GraphQL Support

Meshplay now supports <a href="https://docs.meshplay.khulnasoft.com/concepts/architecture#meshplay-operator-and-meshsync">GraphQL instances</a> between Meshplay UI and Meshplay Server offering any GraphQL client the  power to ask for exactly what they need from mesh. This new API sets the stage preparing for  exciting features in upcoming releases. Extension points are also built into Meshplay's GraphQL support allowing integrators to bring their own GraphQL resolvers to the Meshplay server runtime.


<h2>Meshplay Command Line Interface Enhancements</h2>
The beloved `meshplayctl` introduces new commands in the v0.5.0 release expands the CLI's support of multiple Meshplay deployments with the `context` command and control over when Meshplay auto-updates with the `channel` command.

<h3>Managing Multiple Meshplay Deployments</h3>
Introduced in this release is the meshconfig - a configuration file that describes Meshplay deployments in separate <i>contexts</i>. A Meshplay <i>context</i> describes deployments across Docker hosts and Kubernetes clusters. <code>meshplayctl system context</code> enables user to easy manage multiple deployments of Meshplay by quickly switching contexts. 

### Subscribing to Meshplay Release Channels
`meshplayctl system channel` allows you to easily set and switch between which Meshplay release channel (stable or edge) that you want a particilar Meshplay deployment (`context`) to use. Meshplay deployments subscribe to one of two release channels and can either automatically self-update the deployment or prompt you to update the deployment. Alternatively, you can pin a given Meshplay deployment to a specific release should you want tighter control over when Meshplay updates. Read more about <Link to="https://docs.meshplay.khulnasoft.com/project/build-and-release#release-channels">Meshplay's <i>stable</i> and <i>edge</i> release channels</Link>.
