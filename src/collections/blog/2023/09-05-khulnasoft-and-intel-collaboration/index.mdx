Welcome to another exciting edition of Feature Friday Bulletin, where we unveil the latest enhancements to Meshplay, your go-to service mesh management tool. This week, we're thrilled to announce a groundbreaking collaboration between KhulnaSoft and Intel, bringing you a suite of service mesh management features tailored for WebAssembly-based network traffic management filters in Envoy, the sidecar proxy used in the data plane of Istio. These new features open up a world of possibilities for your service mesh architecture.

## Seamless WASM Envoy Filter Management

With this collaboration, we're introducing powerful features that simplify the management of Envoy WASM filters via Meshplay:

### Meshplay UI and CLI Integration
- **Import WASM Envoy Filters**: Easily import your WebAssembly Envoy filters into Meshplay using the intuitive UI or the command-line interface ([CLI](https://docs.meshplay.khulnasoft.com/reference/meshplayctl#data-plane-intelligence)).
- **Publish and Clone Filters**: Share your filters with the community by publishing them in the [Meshplay Catalog](https://meshplay.khulnasoft.com/catalog) and make it effortless for others to clone them.
- **Download WASM Binaries**: Access and download WebAssembly binaries directly from [KhulnaSoft Cloud](https://meshplay.khulnasoft.com/).
- **Efficient Data Plane Design**: Seamlessly design and deploy Istio and Envoy data planes using [MeshMap](https://khulnasoft.com/cloud-native-management/meshmap).
- **Contribute to Open Source**: Get involved with the service mesh community by contributing to any of the 7 open-source [wasm-filters](https://github.com/khulnasoft/wasm-filters) developed by KhulnaSoft.

### Collaboration and Engagement
