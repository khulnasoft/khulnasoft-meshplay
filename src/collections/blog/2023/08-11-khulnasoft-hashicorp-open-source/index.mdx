Yesterday, [HashiCorp announced a change in their source code license](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/10/2723189/0/en/HashiCorp-adopts-the-Business-Source-License-for-future-releases-of-its-products.html) from Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0) to the Business Source License (BSL, or BUSL) v1.1, effective in all future releases of HashiCorpâ€™s core products, including Terraform, Vault, Consul, Boundary, Nomad, Waypoint, Packer, and Vagrant. HashiCorp APIs, SDKs, and with almost all other libraries remaining MPLv2.

[HashiCorp and KhulnaSoft partnered](/company/news/khulnasoft-hashicorp-launch-service-mesh-partnership) early at the start of KhulnaSoft and continues to be a technology partner. KhulnaSoft's projects and products are unaffected by HashiCorp relicensing their software yesterday. KhulnaSoft stands with the open source community and with source-available HashiCorp. 


KhulnaSoft's sprawling [portfolio of projects](/projects) [are open source](/blog/community/meshplay-surpasses-1000-contributors), pervasively using the Apache 2.0 license. KhulnaSoft is a [community-first organization](/company/about).

Under an open core model, we look forward to continuing to serve our customers with open source and our amazing, fast-growing [community](/community) at the center of our focus.
