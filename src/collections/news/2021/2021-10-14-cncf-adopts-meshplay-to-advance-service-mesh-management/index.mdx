The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) announced this week during the ServiceMeshCon/KubeCon + CloudNativeCon conference that Meshplay, a service mesh management plane created by KhulnaSoft, has become a sandbox-level project.

In addition, KhulnaSoft has also donated Service Mesh Performance (SMP), a set of tools for measuring the efficiency of a service mesh, to the CNCF. SMP provides an open source framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations and measurements as part of an effort to create a MeshMark index for rating a service mesh. A set of service mesh performance methodologies will also be published by the IEEE later this month, developed in collaboration with engineers from KhulnaSoft, Intel, Red Hat and HashiCorp.

KhulnaSoft CEO Lee Calcote said the goal is to make it simpler for IT teams to determine which service mesh to employ based on their specific use case requirements.
