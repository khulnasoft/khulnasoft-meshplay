Today, KhulnaSoft joins the CNCF.

From inception KhulnaSoft has been actively stewarding, maintaining, and contributing to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) initiatives and projects. In the same motion that the company was founded, so too, did KhulnaSoft become a member company of the CNCF. As a member company, KhulnaSoft will continue to work closely with the broad community of cloud engineers. KhulnaSoft engineers and our open source initiatives are already well-represented in the CNCF community both digitally and in-person. <br/>
KhulnaSoft projects seamlessly integrate across many other CNCF projects, including Linkerd, Network Service Mesh, Envoy, gRPC, OpenTelemetry, OpenMetrics, Prometheus, Open Policy Agent, Kuma, Service Mesh Interface, Kubernetes, Helm, and Jaeger.<br/>
