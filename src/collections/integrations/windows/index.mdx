<p>
    Run Meshplay on your Windows desktop. Use the Scoop package for Meshplay's CLI or download `meshplayctl` directly. With `meshplayctl`, you can deploy Meshplay locally on your desktop in Docker or in Kubernetes. Alternatively, you can deploy Meshplay to a remote Kubernetes cluster. Design, test, and manage configuration of all your cloud infrastructure and containerized applications as a visual topology. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshplay Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.
